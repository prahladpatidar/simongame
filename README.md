Simon Says Game
This is a web-based implementation of the classic memory game "Simon Says," created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The game tests the player's memory by challenging them to repeat a sequence of colors that grows longer with each successful round.

## How to Play

Start the Game: Press the "Start Game" button to begin.

Watch the Sequence: The game will flash a sequence of colors. Pay close attention.

Repeat the Sequence: Click on the colored boxes in the exact same order that you saw them flash.

Level Up: If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will move to the next level and add one more color to the sequence.

Game Over: If you click the wrong color, the game will end, and your final score (the last level you completed) will be displayed.

Restart: You can press the "Start Game" button again to play a new game.

Features
Dynamic Levels: The game starts with a simple one-step sequence and gets progressively harder.

Visual Feedback: Buttons flash to show the game's sequence and provide a different flash effect for the user's input.

Score Tracking: The game displays your current level, which acts as your score.

Game Over State: A clear "Game Over" message is displayed with your final score.

Responsive Design: The layout is functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

Clean UI: A simple and intuitive user interface.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure and content of the game.

CSS3: For styling the game, including colors, layout, and animations.
JavaScript: For all the game logic, including generating sequences, handling user input, and tracking the game state.
